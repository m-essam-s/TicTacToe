# PROJECT  Tic-Tac-Toe
## Scenario
Your task is to write a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user. To make it all easier for you, we've decided to simplify the game. Here are our assumptions:
- the computer (i.e., your program) should play the game using 'X's;
- the user (e.g., you) should play the game using 'O's;
- the first move belongs to the computer − it always puts its first 'X' in the middle of the board;
- all the squares are numbered row by row starting with 1 (see the example session below for reference)
- the user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose − the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;
- the program checks if the game is over − there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, the game ends with a tie, you win, or the computer wins;
- the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;
- don't implement any form of artificial intelligence − a random field choice made by the computer is good enough for the game.
The example session with the program may look as follows:

## Requirements
Implement the following features:
- the board should be stored as a three-element list, while each element is another three-element list (the inner lists represent rows) so that all of the squares may be accessed using the following syntax:
``` python
board[row][column]
```
- each of the inner list's elements can contain 'O', 'X', or a digit representing the square's number (such a square is considered free)
- the board's appearance should be exactly the same as the one presented in the example.
- implement the functions defined for you in the editor.
Drawing a random integer number can be done by utilizing a Python function called randrange(). The example program below shows how to use it (the program prints ten random numbers from 0 to 8).

Note: the from-import instruction provides access to the randrange function defined within an external Python module callled random.
~~~python
rom random import randrange 
		for i in range(10):
    print(randrange(8))
~~~
~~~python
def display_board(board):
    # The function accepts one parameter containing the board's current status
    # and prints it out to the console.


def enter_move(board):
    # The function accepts the board's current status, asks the user about their move, 
    # checks the input, and updates the board according to the user's decision.


def make_list_of_free_fields(board):
    # The function browses the board and builds a list of all the free squares; 
    # the list consists of tuples, while each tuple is a pair of row and column numbers.


def victory_for(board, sign):
    # The function analyzes the board's status in order to check if 
    # the player using 'O's or 'X's has won the game


def draw_move(board):
    # The function draws the computer's move and updates the board.
